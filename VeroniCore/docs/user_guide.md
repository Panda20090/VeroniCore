## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS, Linux
- **Python Version:** 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that Python packages such as Flask, JWT, NumPy, and Matplotlib are installed. Use the provided `requirements.txt` file to install all necessary dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your_username/VeroniCore.git
cd VeroniCore

2. Setup Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Application

python app.py

Initial Setup
Upon first running VeroniCore, you will need to configure your environment, including setting up your user profile and initializing the data storage directory.

User Interface
Overview
The VeroniCore UI is designed to be intuitive, with easy access to all major functions. It includes:

Dashboard: Provides a snapshot of your current projects, recent activities, and system status.
Navigation Pane: Access different modules such as data management, simulations, and user settings.
Contextual Menus: Right-click on any item for quick actions.
Navigation
Home: Return to the main dashboard at any time.
Data: Manage your datasets, including uploads, retrievals, and updates.
Simulations: Run and monitor simulations, visualize results, and save reports.
Settings: Update your profile, manage tokens, and configure system preferences.
Key Components
Panels and Widgets: Customize your dashboard with various panels and widgets that display real-time data and insights.
Interactive Buttons: Use buttons to execute tasks, such as running simulations or managing data, directly from the UI.
Data Management
Uploading Data
To upload data to VeroniCore:

Navigate to the Data section.
Click on Upload Data.
Provide a unique ID and the data content in JSON format.
Submit to store the data on the server.
Retrieving Data
Go to Data and select Retrieve Data.
Enter the ID of the data you want to retrieve.
The data will be displayed in JSON format.
Updating Data
Access Data and choose Update Data.
Enter the ID and new content for the data you wish to update.
Submit to overwrite the existing data.
Deleting Data
In the Data section, click on Delete Data.
Provide the ID of the data to be deleted.
Confirm the deletion.
Authentication
User Registration
Register by sending a POST request to /api/users/register with a username and password. Registration will store the user credentials securely.
User Login
Log in via the /api/users/login endpoint by providing your username and password. A successful login returns a JWT token.
Token Management
Token Verification: Ensure your token is valid by sending it to the /api/auth/verify_token endpoint.
Token Refresh: Refresh your token if itâ€™s expired using the /api/auth/refresh_token endpoint.
Simulations
Running Simulations
Configure and run simulations from the Simulations section. You can specify parameters and run scenarios using built-in or custom models.
Visualization Tools
Visualize simulation results directly within VeroniCore using built-in tools. You can create 3D plots and analyze data using the visualization manager.
Analyzing Results
Use the analysis tools provided to dive deep into your simulation results, generate reports, and export data for further use.
Customizing VeroniCore
Adding New Modules
VeroniCore is modular by design. You can add new features by developing additional modules and integrating them into the existing framework.
Integrating with External APIs
Connect VeroniCore to external services via APIs. Use the provided actions_handler.py and api_manager.py to set up integrations.
Advanced Configuration
Access advanced settings to configure logging, error handling, and system behaviors. Use the configuration files located in the config directory.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Installation Errors: Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly. Check Python and package versions.
Login Failures: Verify that the credentials are correct and that the JWT token is valid.
Simulation Failures: Review the simulation parameters and logs to ensure everything is configured properly.
Error Handling
Review error logs located in the logs directory. Common errors include 404 (resource not found) and 500 (internal server error).
Getting Support
For additional support, consult the VeroniCore Documentation or contact the development team via the support channel.
